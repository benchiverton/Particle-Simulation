# Particles
One of my first java projects!

I did not write all of this code! Although I did heavily modify it - for more details on how I modified this code, please check out the first project in the 'projects' section on my website www.benchiverton.co.uk, labelled 'n-dimensional particle simulation' :)

In summary, I wrote all of Renderer.java, and heavily modified Simulation.java and Universe,java. My friend (www.alexlogan.co.uk) wrote the other classes.

This project requires lwjgl, and was originally written using the build: LWJGL 3.0.0b build 64

Any feedback/suggestions are heavily appreciated!

Thankyou! :)
